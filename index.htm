            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                I currently work for PwC in the Operate Digital Development team.
                I'm between projects at the moment and have time to develop and enhance my skills.
                It's been sometime since I've learned Web Development, and I've always had a strong interest
                but not a lot of confidence in my skills. I'm currently working on The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp
                course on Udemy. I hope to improve my skills and pick up some new ones along the way.
            </p>
